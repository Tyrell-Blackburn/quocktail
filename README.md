# Quocktail

Quocktail is designed to help bartenders and mixologist locate cocktail recipes quickly. Cocktails themselves are dear to my heart, and I enjoy experimenting with and making cocktails at home. Check it out [here](https://www.quocktail.com).

This is my first original project using React.js, Material UI, and Tanstack Router (what an incredible library!).
It leverages the [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) for all recipe text and images.

## Features used

1. GET requests are made using Fetch, Axios, and Tanstack Router (If I have time I will refactor to just use Tanstack Router).
2. At least 95% of the code is React or Material UI components. Very little vanilla HTML elements are used. 
3. Almost all styling is achieved through the inline sx property on Material UI components.

## Features to add

1. Add a favourites feature using local storage.
2. Add the ability to add your own cocktails to the database.
